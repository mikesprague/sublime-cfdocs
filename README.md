# Search CFDocs


## About
This is a [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) plugin allowing you to easily search the [CFDocs](cfdocs.org) documentation.

The plugin code is based on the [Search DevDocs](https://github.com/vitorbritto/sublime-devdocs) script by Vitor Britto.


## Usage

### Search by selection
Highlight text, right click & click "Search CFDocs" to open a new tab on your web browser with the info.

### Search by input
1. Open your command pallete with `ctrl + shift + p` (Linux/Windows) or `cmd + shift + p` (OS X)
2. Type "cfdocs"
3. Select "Search From Input"
4. Type your keyword

***You can also use the shortcut (`ctrl + alt + c`).***

## Installation
The easiest way to install this is with [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime\_packages/package\_control).

* If you just went and installed Package Control, you probably need to restart Sublime Text before doing this next bit.
* Bring up the Command Palette (Command+Shift+p on OS X, Control+Shift+p on Linux/Windows).
* Select "Package Control: Install Package" (it'll take a few seconds)
* Select Search CFDocs when the list appears.

Package Control will automatically keep Git up to date with the latest version.

If you have some problems or improvements with it, [contact me](https://github.com/mikesprague/sublime-cfdocs/issues) via GitHub.
